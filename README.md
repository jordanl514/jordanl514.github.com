## 🧑‍💻 Points of note before you contribute!

Point out the most important files and bits of knowledge that a user might need before they choose to contribute.

**If the repo has a production status, please use this:**
### This repository has a production status
Kindly review the following information regarding the production status of this repository: [Production Status Notes](https://www.notion.so/GitHub-d8cfe38cbd38449397cc5e87f48b5874?pvs=4#dc20dab5d31548a1ae756ba6637532ce)

The primary branch designated for production is the main branch. Consequently, any modifications to this branch will trigger an automatic generation of a new application build on the cloud hosting service. Given this automated deployment process, it is imperative to recognise the significant implications associated with deploying untested code. Please ensure that thorough testing has been conducted to validate the application's readiness for production use. 

We strongly recommend the practice of creating new branches specifically for testing purposes. Once these branches have undergone necessary testing and received approval, they can be merged into the main branch. This meticulous approach is crucial to maintaining the integrity and stability of the production environment.
